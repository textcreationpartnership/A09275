         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In ſteed of an Epiſtle to the Reader: I am bold to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
<pb facs="tcp:15703:6"/> you in ſpeciall to be the Readers. I did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by that late confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that I had with you, that you love not to have your mercies magnified and proclaimed before others, much leſſe before your owne ſelves: you would not have the left hand know, what the right hand doth, nor any Trumpet to bee blowne at the diſtribution of your Almes. You doe well to follow the good advice and Precept of the Sonne of God. But your worke of Pietie, in providing for mens ſoules; and that other of Charitie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the bodies of the truely indigent and penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb facs="tcp:15703:6"/> together with the education and inſtruction of poore mens Children, (all which you have done in the place of your Nativitie, knowing right well that Charitie ought to beginne at home.) I ſay, theſe reall practiſes, and viſible expreſſions of your Chriſtianitie, are ſo obvious to the eye and view of this your Native Countrey, that they can no more bee hid, than the Sunne at Noone-day. I hope this my labour and diſcourſe of Almeſ-giving will not any way coole the fervour of your Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table affections; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther animate and enflame you to the practiſe of
<pb facs="tcp:15703:7"/> more good deedes, and good duties, and to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proficiencie in the Schoole of grace.

Saint <hi>Paule</hi> was very frequent in this ſubject, and with much vehemencie of ſpirit, he often preſſeth the practice of Charitie in moſt of his Epiſtles, putting the ſame Auditors in minde againe and againe of the ſame dutie, as being a leſſon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be unlearned and forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but worthy to be imprinted with a pen of Iron, or the point of a Diamond in the everlaſting tables of their hearts: He char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <hi>Timothy</hi> alſo to urge this ſo commendable and neceſſarie a doctrine upon his Hearers, that as they did abound in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſſings, and worldly wealth, they might alſo be rich in good works. In this poynt we have the practice, conſent, and unanimous approbation of learned Fathers. Saint <hi>Austin,

               <p>Now we that are Diſpenſers of the Myſteries of the Goſpell muſt goe before others, not in precept onely, but alſo in exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; wee muſt confirme by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice what in Doctrine we teach: therefore wee that are Preachers of Charitie muſt bee practizers thereof our ſelves: the latter is moſt effectuall of the two to winne mens affections.

Though the Sunne and Moone thoſe more reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and admirable Creatures, by reaſon of their exceeding brightneſſe beare away the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the one of the day, the other of the night, yet there is never a little ſtarre in the firmament, but doth in ſome meaſure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion contribute to enlighten the Heavens: So likewiſe ought

Wee muſt chiefly remember to reach forth our helping hands to the poore, and to communicate to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities according to our ſeverall abilities, and their preſent wants and exigencies. We are placed in the Church militant as the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wheels in a Jacke, if we ſtand ſtill, and doe nothing, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe or motion can be expected from the people in any good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It were a wiſe courſe, if we would imitate our Saviour Chriſt, and make him our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne in this, and all the other actions and paſſages of our life: As he taught others to be chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15703:15"/> ſo he led them the way by his owne example, he kept a Bag out of which he was wont to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute ſomething to the poore, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 29. albeit he himſelfe in reſpect of his temporall and worldly ſtate and condition was deepely poore and penurious, he being not ſo much as owner of a poore Cottage, as man, who as<note place="margin">Matt. 8. 20.</note> God was the great Land-lord of the whole world, nay if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> well, we ſhal finde that he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lived of the Charitie and benevolence of holy and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous women, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 3. If we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the Maſter to the Scholars, we ſhall finde <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> an Apoſtolicall man won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully addicted to workes of mercy, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 37. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> propounding unto <hi>Timothy</hi> his owne example, life, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, his gifts and ſpirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, thereby to ſtirre him up to the like vertues, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

Now it remaines that we regulate and faſhion our lives by the examples of theſe Saints, let us doe and teach as Chriſt did, preach and practiſe as the Apoſtles did, for if we doe confirme and ſtrengthen our good words by good works, and adde good doings to good ſayings, we ſhall be able to ſtop the barking mouthes of all gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, prevent the fleſhly reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of carnall men, utterly take away all thoſe excuſes, pretexts, and ſubterfuges, whereby the craftie worldlings are wont to privilege themſelves from the practice of this dutie. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15703:16"/> wee may bee emboldned to preſſe the exerciſe of this Grace the more boldly, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our ſelves the more freely to the Conſciences of our Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, when they know wee are not like ſounding braſſe or tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling Cimbals, clouds without water, ſtarres without light, or like emptie veſſels which ſound loudeſt, but that wee have open hands, as well as open mouthes, and that wee adorne our high Calling and Profeſſion with a ſutable Converſation.</p>
               <p>Having thus made way to our words by our owne workes, we may cheriſh and entertaine the greater hope, that wee ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with our hearers, who in generall cannot but much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud and highly extoll almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, and workes of mercie: There are none of the ſonnes or daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> of ſo depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved natures and inhumane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, but will put their ſeale

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15703:17"/> into reall actions, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and private expreſſions of their love, and tender-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, towards their comfortleſſe and needie brethren.</p>
               <p>Tis well wee have their generall allowance and conſent, for thereupon may wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a more particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and urge the preſent exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and perſonall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this dutie, which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally neglected of moſt ſorts of men, even now in this cleare and glorious Sun-ſhine of the Goſpell. Who would imagine that theſe warme and redoubled beames of the word ſhould not be able to thaw and reſolve the icie congealed, and frozen hearts of covetous Earth-wormes, and carnall worldlings into melting affections of love, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but that wee know, that clay will waxe more obdurate, and the harder in the brighteſt ſunneſhine, and that the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mants,

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15703:30"/> Authorizers of the Law, thus to provide for the relieving of the poore, yet if thou doſt no more than the Law compels thee to doe, thou haſt not ſo much as a dramme of pittie within thee; for that is ſcarſe charitie, when by humane compulſion or importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie men give unto the poore, but when out of an unfained love to God, and a tender and ſimpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing affection towards their Brethren, they freely diſtribute to the ſeverall neceſſities of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe Chriſtians.

Thirdly, The Law provides not a ſalve for every ſore, a ſupply for every mans want; I could reckon up a whole catalogue of good works which are neither mentioned nor commanded by the Law.

               <p>Wee want not examples and noble Preſidents for the clearing of this truth, many that have benne poore in ſtate, have benne rich in good workes: Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt was no rich man, hee had no <note n="k" place="margin">Matth. 8. 20.</note> habitation to dwell in of his owne, no livings or lands, or large revenues, but the hands of others <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 8. 3, 4.</note> miniſtred unto him,

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15703:34"/> Charitable uſes. Such pretious flowers growes not in everie garden.</p>
               <p>Now for the Incouragement of ſuch as out of their owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall labours, and difficult acquiſitions can finde in their hearts to be liberall and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and are ready to conforme to theſe notable and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent patternes, let them take theſe things into their thoughts and meditations. Firſt, that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are not left to poſterity for admiration, but for Imitation as wee may collect out of that precept of the Prince and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the world <note n="r" place="margin">Luk. 16. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>Goe thou and doe likewiſe.</hi> Theſe <note n="ſ" place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> Cloudes of witneſſes wherewith wee are compaſſed round about ſhould direct and teach us, as the Cloud did the Iſraelites in the true way and path of Bleſſedneſſe which leads directly unto the ſpirituall and heavenly Canaan. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the only end which they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15703:34"/> muſt aime at in all their actions, imployments and Corpore all ſweatings and endeavours, is not to uphold their owne families, and to mainetaine themſelves and their dependants but to <note n="t" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 28.</note> relieve and ſuſtaine their needy and oppreſſed neighbours, and this is a thing that few men dreame of. Thirdly, That in ſo giving, they doe performe a double duty both moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and well pleaſing to the Lord: Firſt, in that they labour to ſupport the weake and feeble members of Chriſt with their bountie and beneficence: And ſecondly, in that they earneſtly endeavour as much as in them lyeth, by the flame and light of their pious actions to thaw and diſſolve the frozen hearts of rich and churliſh <hi>Nabals,</hi> and <hi>to</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Epheſ. 10. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them unto Love, and to good workes:</hi> or if by their zeale, and forwardneſſe they can nothing move others nor ſqueeze any
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15703:35"/> water out of thoſe flints, not a droppe of pittie from theſe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Adamants, yet if nature bee not alſo quite extinct as well as grace, they cannot but make them aſhamed of themſelves, and leave them the more excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe before God. Fourthly, that thou, who art a poore man, but yet a charitable Chriſtian, doſt evidently expreſſe a farre greater meaſure of ſtrong and unfeined faith in Gods promiſes, of ſincere obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and of hearty love and compaſſion towards thy needie brethren, then thoſe who out of their abundance give larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and multiply their contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions daily towards the poore. To beleeve when the face of God ſhines upon men with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible refreſhing, and in the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous noonetide of proſperity to ſing ſweetely, and to teſtifie their thankefulneſſe unto the Lord, by parting with this or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15703:35"/> that ſuperfluous and ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant portion to the needy is no ſuch great matter. But then to beleeve when his ſhining coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is eclipſed, and in the blackeſt midnight of adverſitie to cleave and adhere cloſe unto Chriſt, than to bee willing to communicate, and of a little to parte with a little, this is a moſt excellent act of faith, and argues a ſtrong confidence and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon Gods providence. Fifthly, let them conſider that that ſmall pittance, which they give with a chearefull minde, may affect their ſoules with more comfort and conſolation, then the great ones can ſucke out of their more plentifull doles and Almeſ-deeds.</p>

Shee may bee, nay ſhe muſt bee ever charitably minded, though ſhe cannot alwaies bee as open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed as ſhee pleaſe, and yet we finde in the Scriptures, that many wives had both hearts, and hands too, to give to the poore.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15703:43"/> might ſtand with Gods glorie; the rules of religion, and their husbands abilities.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The grace of Charitie, whereſoever it is (and it ought to bee in a wife, as well as in a husband, there is an equall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of that grace both in the one and in the other, and the Holy Ghoſt in the free diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and effuſion of his ſaving gifts, reſpects no places, perſons or Sexes) is a predominant and operative grace, and will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſhew it ſelfe: It will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the whole man to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of goodneſſe, imploy every ſence and member in a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble buſineſſe, ſet the heart open, the bowels open, the eares open, the eyes open, and the hands open to the comfortleſſe and needy Chriſtians.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15703:43"/> the extremely miſerable and diſtreſſed brethren.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the better incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them to this dutie, let them remember that there are many examples recorded in the Scriptures for their inſtruction, and imitation. The Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the choiſe of a widdow, deſcribes her by her life paſt when ſhee was a wife, and ſets downe that ſhee muſt bee ſuch a one as hath beene the <note n="u" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 9. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>wife of one Husband, well reported of for good workes, a bringer up of Children, a lodger of ſtrangers, a releever of the afflicted, &amp;c.</hi> And <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 9 10.</note> elſewhere ſpeaking of wives and married women concludes that they ought <hi>to abound in this grace alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They are made heires with<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7.</note> their husbands togither of the ſame grace of life and glorie, and why ſhould they not partake with them of <hi>the grace of charity</hi> as the <note n="x" place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 6, 7.</note> Apoſtle calleth it. They
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:15703:44"/> may enjoy, embrace and follow the Miniſtery of the Word, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 5. and why ſhould they not practiſe theſe generall Chriſtian duties commended and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the ſame Word? They are Gods workemanſhip as well as men <hi>created in Chriſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Jeſus unto good workes,</hi> and ought they not then to walke in them, and to bee zealous of the ſame? If any therefore falſely conceive that women, <hi>quatenus</hi> wives, may be excepted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from liberalitie and almeſ-giving, they groſſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves, for with what comfort can they looke Chriſt<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> in the face at the laſt day, if they never fed, or clothed, or viſited him in his members here on earth: And further I muſt let them know that Matrimonie was inſticuted to be a bridle for ſinne, and not to be a hindrance or obſtacle in religion and pious performances.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:15703:44"/>
               <p>But that wives may give, will not (I ſuppoſe) bee denied or gaine-ſaid by any, yet that none might be miſtaken in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, here next we are to conſider and lay downe a few rules and neceſſarie obſervations in this point of wives almes-giving. Firſt, what wives are fit to give. Secondly, whereof they may give. Thirdly, how they ought to carrie and demean themſelves in giving. For the firſt, you muſt know that all are not of capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, underſtanding, and diſcretion to diſtribute judiciouſly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly to the truly miſerable, ſome of that Sexe are ſuch brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, heartleſſe, careleſſe, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they have neither a will to give, nor a hand to work, nor a wit to diſcerue betweene the unworthie conditions and true wants of the diſtreſſed. Therefore for the clearing and reſolution of all doubts, and the preventing of all cavils and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15703:45"/> needleſſe queſtions, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce wives into two rankes, whereof ſome are ſufficiently qualified and fit to give, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not. <hi>Wives unfit to give are ſuch as theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The woman who is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of wiſedome and diſcretion characterized by <hi>Salomon</hi> in the Proverbs and ſet out by theſe<note place="margin">Prov. 19. 3. &amp; 11. 22.</note> Epithets, <hi>fooliſh, ſimple, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete, knowing nothing:</hi> for as it is ſaid of a fooliſh man, that hee will <note n="y" place="margin">Prov. 21. 20.</note> ſpend up the oile and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the wiſe, ſo much more truely may it be ſaid concerning a fooliſh woman, who is ſo farre from maintaining or ſupporting a houſe or family, that ſhee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily <note n="z" place="margin">Pro. 14. 1.</note>

Therefore it will not bee amiſſe for mee to teach, and others to learne how to doe a good worke. Now it may bee learned two manner of wayes, by the Goſpell, and by the Law: Firſt by the Goſpell which teacheth us</p>
               <p n="1">1. To have an eye and to<note place="margin">Matt. 3. 17.</note> looke unto Chriſt in whom only God is pacified and wel pleaſed, and by whom all things that by reaſon of ſinne were at ods, are againe reconciled betweene the guiltie creature and the angrie Judge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To reflect backe upon our owne perſons, and ſeriouſly to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15703:59"/> conſider what intereſt wee have in Chriſt Jeſus, and his merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious purchaſe, that ſo wee may be aſſured that our ſacrifices will ſend up a ſweet ſmell, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſavour into the noſtrils of the Almightie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To looke there bee grace in us, as our faith (<hi>without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God</hi>) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> love, brotherly kindneſſe, humilitie, patience, and other ſpirituall abilities and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For you muſt know that the Goſpell by the Synergie and cooperation of the Spirit doth inlighten the underſtanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the nature, change the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, batter into peeces the ſtonie heart, plant ſaving graces, and ſow the ſeed of immortalitie in the ſoule, and then when it is thus well pruned, harrowed, tempered, and ſanctified by the Word, it brings forth plentifully the fruits of good works. So then you ſee wee muſt firſt view the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15703:60"/> faces of our ſoules in the pure glaſſe of the Goſpell, whether they beare any conformitie with the Image of Chriſt, whether they bee adorned and beautified with the Graces of the Holy Ghoſt, before we can aſſure our ſelves that our works are truely good, and ſaving acceptable to the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To looke unto our lives and converſations: Charitie, a pure heart, and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are ever neere neighbours,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 5.</note> and lodge cloſe together, and no man can dole charitably to the poore, that doth not deale con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably with his neighbour. The ſame tree cannot naturally bring forth ſweete and bitter, ſound and rotten fruits together: So likewiſe the ſame man cannot bee a liberall giver to the poore, and an unconſtionable couzner of his brother. There muſt bee a Spirituall harmonie and unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie betweene all our actions, a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15703:60"/> conformitie in them with the pure precepts of God, and then we may boldly conclude the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie of a good work. None I am ſure are in the Scriptures commended for their merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and almes-deeds, but ſuch as are otherwiſe deſcribed by other ſaving and eminent graces and good parts. Revolve and conſider with your ſelves the manifold <note n="b" place="margin">Job. 1. 1. Act. 10. 1. Phil. 5. 7. Act. 4. &amp; 11. 24.</note> examples which are obvious to your obſervation, both in the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and you ſhall finde this truth as cleere and evident as the noone-day.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Goſpell teacheth us<note place="margin">Nehem. 13 22.</note> to looke ever to Gods mercy in Chriſt, and not to our owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in any worke we doe: for do what we can, wee can doe but our dutie, <hi>ſtill we are but unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſervants:</hi> One little dead fly will ſpoile a whole boxe of pretious oyntment, ſo one dram of merit will marre the beſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15703:61"/> and greateſt good worke. Thus learne wee a good worke from the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>2. From the Law which teacheth us. Firſt, that we muſt doe a good worke from the love of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 17. this the Law inſtructeth us in the firſt place, and ſo our Saviour Chriſt enformeth us, and therefore<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 38.</note> whenſoever wee intend a good worke, our chiefeſt care muſt be to ſee that it may conſiſt with true holineſſe, and that it is not contrarie and repugnant unto the honour, glorie, and worſhip of the living and eternall God. If any pretended good worke tend to the erection of idolatrie, to the maintenance and ſupportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of falſe worſhips and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or bee any way derogatorie to the Name of the Lord, that worke is directly condemned by the Law as full of ſinne and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquitie.</p>
               <p>2. That we muſt do a good
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15703:61"/> worke from the love of our ſelves unto our neighbours,<note place="margin">Matth. 19. 19.</note> whom wee are commanded to love as our owne ſelves: and here ſpeciall heed muſt be taken; that the good worke ſtand with the preſervation of our owne and our neighbours dignitie, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, chaſtitie, equitie, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, according as the rules of the ſecond table binde and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us. For our Saviour Chriſt ſharpely reproves the Jewes for there <hi>Corban,</hi> becauſe a gift with<note place="margin">Matt. 15. 6.</note> contempt or neglect of ones du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to his parents and ſuperiours is no way tolerable or allowable. <note n="*" place="margin">

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:15703:62"/>
               <p>Laſtly, the goodneſſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of a worke is loſt and quite mar'd, if it be incompatible with innocency, equitie, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, any way injurious or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> to any, for Charitie is a friend to innocencie and right, an utter enemy to deceit, untruth, and fraudulent dealing. It never wrongs any, but rather ſuffers, covers and palliates multitudes of undeſerved and diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble injuries. From all this that hath beene ſpoken may wee learne eaſily to confute the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and ſelfe-deceiving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of thoſe men who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>

This is a flower that growes not ordinarily in every Garden: It is a ſupernaturall and infuſed, not acquired habite, and never comes into the heart till it be planted there by the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate finger of the Holy Ghoſt.

               <p n="6">6. From a groundleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of meriting Heaven, this is the poyſon that invenomes and infecteth ſome of the good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Papiſts, and makes them to bee odious and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the ſight of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Thus you ſee there be many falſe grounds on which moſt men build their good workes: They are but ſandie foundations and therefore the ſuperſtructions cannot be laſting.</p>
               <p>Now the true ſaving grace of Charitie, which is a ray of the Divine Majeſtie, a pure beame of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, is firmly grounded on the deare love of God revealed in the face
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15703:64"/> of Jeſus Chriſt to every truly humble and broken-hearted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it warmes the Chriſtians heart with a Heavenly and holy heate of impartiall affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all the naked and needy members of Chriſt: It teacheth him to hate father and mother in caſe they bee Remoraes and pull-backes from Heaven, to cleave cloſe unto the flocke of Gods faithfull Saints and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to relieve them, love them, live and dye with them. This is Charity indeed.</p>
               <p>2. That all kindes of givers<note place="margin">The ſecond errour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> are Charitable perſons, this is as full of abſurdity as the former: for a truly Charitable man muſt be a <hi>good man,</hi> a <hi>gracious man,</hi> a <hi>righteous man,</hi> as the Plalmiſt intitleth him: hee muſt bee <hi>holy</hi>

This is not the beſt charitie to give a thing when a man can keepe it no longer, and like a fatted ſwine to feede thoſe being dead, which in his life time he grunted at, reviled, ſcorned, and contemned.

Among the reſt, they muſt bee done affectionately, willingly, and with a kinde of delectation of the minde. So likewiſe in the performance of any religious Actions and good workes, all theſe circumſtances muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, they muſt bee done in a
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:15703:107"/> right manner, to a right end, and with a ready and willing minde and affection: Firſt, then wee muſt bee prepared in Affection, and then, Secondly, performe in Action.</p>
               <p>To bee prepared in affection, we muſt often revolve and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon thoſe former motives, which are of a very attractive power, to draw the moſt Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted worldling, to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of good works: wee muſt lay to heart and obediently ſtoope to the ſerious Precepts of God the Father and our bleſſed Saviour, by conſidering the great Authoritie of the Commander, the neceſſitie of the Dutie, the Benefits, Honour, and Utilitie, which will accrew unto us by the faithfull diſcharge thereof, and the great diſhonour we ſhall doe unto God, and the ſhame and unavoydable confuſion, and diſgrace we ſhall bring unto our owne ſelves, if wee wilfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:15703:108"/> and omit ſo gratious and honourable a practiſe: Wee muſt value and prize the exerciſe of this grace of love, before the<note place="margin">Col. 3. 14. Rom. 13. 10</note> conſtant performance of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther morall duties: for this is the bond of perfection, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law, as the Apoſtle calls it. Wee muſt repoſe and without ſtaggering faſten our faith and confidence on thoſe immutable and everlaſting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which God hath made unto all mercifull and charitable minded men: for if wee truſt in<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 3.</note> him, we ſhall certainly bee ever doing good, and if wee ſeriouſly meditate on thoſe many moſt ſweete and gratious promiſes mentioned before, and perſwade our ſelv's that he is Al-ſufficient, and the God of Truth, that can<note place="margin">Ezech. 37. 14.</note> and will performe what he hath ſpoken, we cannot chuſe but be ready and willing to doe good workes. If we take God on his owne Word, beleeve and ſet to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:15703:108"/> our ſeale that he is true, how is it poſſible wee ſhould ever ſhut up our hearts, or withdraw our hands from releeving the poore? We doe eaſily credit great men for great matters without Bill or Bond, and willingly depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſufficiencie and fidelitie, and ſhall we not much more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely reſt on Gods promiſes,<note place="margin">Matth 5. 7.</note> who hath not onely given us his Word, but the Word of his Son, the Word of his Servants, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Apoſtles, and not only their bare Words, but their Bils to ſhew, their Words under unqueſtionable Hand-writing. What, ſhall we put more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a worme, in the arme of fleſh, in the ſonnes of men, who are but graſſe, and whoſe breath is in their noſtrils, than in the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient and Eternall God, who never failes nor forſakes thoſe that put their truſt in him? There is no man, I know, but conceives ſo good an opinion of himſelfe,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:15703:109"/> that he will boldly proteſt that he doth beleeve in God, and will bee ready to ſpit in his face that ſhould tell him the contrary: Thou doſt well to beleeve, but doſt thou hoard up thy wealth for thy ſelfe, and thy poſteritie onely, carke and care for future times immoderately, never think on the poore brethren, to releeve or ſuſtaine them? Doe they beg or would they borrow of thee, and doſt thou give them good words onely, and tell them that thou canſt not ſpare them that they deſire, becauſe thou thy ſelfe maiſt lacke before thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, if thou ſhouldeſt bee ſo free hearted?

               <p>'Tis no ſuch eaſie matter (as men may thinke it) to be affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately charitable: till wee can ſay as <hi>Job</hi> could, <hi>Did not I weepe</hi>

                  <hi>for him that was in trouble, was not my ſoule grieved for the poore?</hi> Wee are not feelingly affected with the miſeries of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, nor inſenſible enough of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:15703:110"/> their dolefull ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is indeed, a humane pittie, and naturall compaſſion, which a Heathen man cannot put off ſometimes, and upon ſome occaſions, but the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſſe, and charitable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection we heere ſpeake of, is not naturall, but a Celeſtiall habite, a Creature of the holy Ghoſt: And therefore wee muſt labour<note place="margin">1 King. 8. 50.</note> to put on this Grace by uſing theſe preſcribed meanes. Firſt, By praying frequently and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently unto God, that he would bee pleaſed to plant the noble grace of Charitie in our hearts, to warme our ſoules with the Holy heate of brotherly love, and a tender ſenſibleneſſe of the wants and diſtreſſes of the poor. Charitie and tender-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the reſt of thoſe rare and precious Jewels are all, wee know the gifts of God, and lockt up faſt in his Heavenly cloſſet, Now prayer is the key,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:15703:111"/> and will open the locke to fetch them out, if there bee the hand of Faith to turne it. Therefore pray we muſt, or no hope of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Charitie. But what man almoſt mindes this Grace in his prayers and requeſts unto God. Give me leave to aske thee Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, didſt thou ever begge ſuch a bleſſing, or preſent ever ſuch a Petition unto the Throne of Grace. Lord give unto me bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of compaſſion and a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling affection towards my needy and diſconſolate bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Bethinke thy ſelfe a while and call thy ſelfe to remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, if not, Oh then beſiege Chriſts mercy-Seat with redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſupplications, and never leave, though thou turneſt thy knees into hornes, till thou haſt importuned and obtained ſome ſparkes, ſome degrees of that vertue, which will enrich thee everlaſtingly. Secondly, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying home to our ſelves others
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:15703:111"/> miſeries, from the apprehenſion of our owne accidentarie wants, and extremities, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may unawares and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly befall us. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when wee accidentally chance to be from home abrode in the fields without harbour, to lie occaſionally upon ſome hard bed, to feele cold, hunger, thirſt, &amp;c. to which the richeſt are ſometimes as obnoxious, as the beggar; then we ſhould make a good conſtruction of theſe evill occurrents, and take occaſion thereby to conſider on the like caſes and extremities of thoſe who are continually almoſt pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with cold and hunger and nakedneſſe: And ſo wee ſhould learne by our owne experiences, to ſympathize with them and to commiſerate their neceſſities. <hi>Remember</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>them that are in Bonds, as bound with them, and them which ſuffer adverſitie, as being your ſelves
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:15703:112"/> alſo in the bodie:</hi> When we heare of the perſecution and incarcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome of the Saints and Servants of God, who are thus maligned and moſt undeſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and baſely handled for a good Conſcience and the Goſpels ſake, we muſt ſuppoſe their caſe to be our owne, and never thinke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the glorious Martyrs of Jeſus Chriſt, but with a preſent admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods great goodneſſe and forbearance towards us, who, when as ſome of his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſervants have ſwimme in bloody Coffins, others ride in Coches of fire to Heaven, hath yet ſuffered us to goe thither as it were on our feather beds. This ſeaſonable application of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Joſephs</hi> wrongs and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to our owne perſons, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely is that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and may bee a good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to worke us to compaſſion. This was it that drew teares from <hi>Jobs</hi> eyes in the Sunſhine of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie,<note place="margin">Job. 30. 25.</note>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:15703:112"/> and made <hi>Nehemiah</hi> a<note place="margin">Neh. 1. 3. 4. 11.</note> man of Eminencie and Honour to weepe, mourne, faſt and pray, for the afflictions of Jeruſalem, and to make all poſſible meanes to the great Perſian king to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his afflicted brethren in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea. Thirdly, by conſidering our neereneſſe and proximitie to them, our union and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, as they are either the ſonnes and daughters of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo they bee our bone and fleſh, and fellow bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: or as they live in the ſame Domioion under the ſame King, and ſo they bee our fellow-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or fellow-Cittizens; or as they be the Peculiar flocke, and Heavenly off-ſpring of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo they be our fellow-members. Theſe be good meanes to kindle in us charitable affections towards them, and to move us to put on bowels of mercie. But none of theſe things will ſerve the turne, if wee doe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:15703:113"/> not remove one maine obſtacle and impediment, and that is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, that curſed roote and fountaine of much miſchiefe and villanie. 'Tis a moſt peſtilent, abhorred, zeale-deading and ſoule-murthering ſinne, it infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuates and bewitcheth the ſoule, captivates the will, diſtracts the affections, hardneth the heart, and turneth it into a peece of Earth and clay, and maketh it altogether as inſenſible of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans miſery, as a hardned flint. Therefore if ever wee will be prepared in affection to doe works of mercy, wee muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this <hi>Dagon,</hi> tumble downe this idoll out of the temples of our ſoules, we muſt make <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> our ſlave and ſervant, and not be the ſervant of <hi>Mammon.</hi> Now the beſt way to bee rid of this foule Feinde, and impoyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all goodneſſe, is to make God our portion as <hi>David</hi> did. <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 57.</note> And this we do when we make
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:15703:113"/> him our onely refuge and <hi>Aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> deſire nothing but him, ſeeke nothing but him, finde all joy and contentment in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, glory, and goodneſſe, reſt in his All-ſufficiencie, depend upon his Promiſes, and adhere unto him only in all conditions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Now wee can no way better evidence that wee wholy rely on the Lord, and make him our portion, then by keeping <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 57.</note> his Words, by obſerving his Precepts, and more ſpecially by our liberall contributions to his naked and needy members.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The practice of laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide for charitable uſes is both preſcribed unto us by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Ghoſt, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently warranted unto us, by Apoſtolical authoritie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2.

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:15703:115"/>2. It is a <hi>treaſuring</hi> up unto God, for ſo the word is in the originall <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">2 Cor. 16. 2</note> practiſe our Almighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour doth both command, and expect from, and accept at our hands. Our ſoules and bodies he freely gaue us, and being loſt, and forfeited to the Divell by <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience, he againe redeemed them, with both theſe therefore muſt we <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> glorifie him, and hee gave us our goods too, and therefore with them alſo muſt we <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 3. 9.</note> honour him, we muſt uſe them for, and referre them to his onely Glory. It is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 11. of the <hi>Wiſe men,</hi> that when they had found Chriſt, they opened their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, out of which they preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto their Savior gifts, gold, frankincenſe, and mirrhe. Did thoſe <hi>Magi,</hi> the firſt fruits and preludes of the Gentiles unto God, without any Apoſtolicall direction, or written precept,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:15703:115"/> provide: treaſure for Chriſt, and ſhall not wee who have both precept, example, and direction for it out of Gods holy booke, prouide treaſures alſo, out of which wee may offer unto our Saviour gifts, ſilver, and gold, when good opportunitie ſhall be offered in his afflicted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a preparation to lend unto the Lord, as by laying up in thy coffer bagges of gold and ſilver thou doſt prepare (if an uſurer moſt unlawfully) to lend to thy neighbours, friends, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: ſo by ſeparation of ſome part of thy wealth for good and charitable uſes, thou doſt prouide to lend unto the Lord. When thou haſt ſeparated it and layd it aſide, tis the Lords I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, but not yet actually, and really lent: when God ſhall ſend ſome poore and diſtreſſed members of his unto thee, and thou either feede, cloath, or any
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:15703:116"/> other way refreſh them, with thy ſanctified and conſecrated <note place="margin">Pro. 19. 17.</note> riches, then thou maiſt be ſaid <hi>to lend unto the Lord.</hi> This du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here, is onely a preparing to lend unto him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a ſtrong witneſſe and infallible Teſtimony of thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable ſoule, whereby God makes experiment and full triall of thy tender-heartedneſſe, loue, pittie, and compaſſion: the hoarding and laying up of all thy other ſubſtance may ſerve to beare witneſſe againſt thee of thy earthlineſſe, carking, and <note place="margin">Jam. 5. 3.</note> worldly-mindedneſſe, but this laying aſide will beare witneſſe for thee, of thy readineſſe to ſhew mercy, bounty and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It incites, and provokes men forward unto the acts of charity, and makes them plot and deviſe how to expend it to Gods glory &amp; their neighbours good, which is the duty of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:15703:116"/> man. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 32. 8. For that which they have conſecrated to good uſes, is now no longer their owne, either <hi>jure proprietatis,</hi> or <hi>jure uſus,</hi> and therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <note place="margin">Conſider Dauids bounty. 1. Chron. 29. 2. and yet his prayer. Pſal. 119. 36.</note> not to preſerve and hoard it up for poſterity, as they do their other goods, but are at all times propenſe, and ready upon every good and ſeaſonable occaſion, or opportunitie to part from it, and to beſtow it freely and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in charitable workes. Thou art by nature covetous, and an earth-worme, impotent, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, dull, and ſlow to good works, uſe then this duty here preſcribed, as a ſpurre to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, animate, and pricke thee forward.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By the practiſe of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a man excerciſeth privately before God his obedience, his faith, and charitie, and ſuffers not his charitable intentions to bee loſt, nor his purpoſe to do good to come to nothing: but by the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:15703:117"/> frequent, and conſtant perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this Chriſtian duty of laying aſide weekely, he fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and thrives in goodneſſe, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on and growes more and more, till he aſpireth unto the perfection of charity, as in other graces to the full ſtature of Chriſt Jeſus. The diffuſive and penetrating heate of this fervent grace of charity doth enlive, as it were the ſtupid ſoule of a chriſtian, revive the other infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed graces and ſupernaturall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and keepe them in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall action. For as the upper wheele in a jacke, by its moving makes all the under wheeles to ſtirre alſo in a circular motion. ſo the exerciſing and agitation of this ſupreme and moſt noble grace of charity, ſets a working all inferiour graces, as faith, hope, patience, humility &amp;c. and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them not to ware faint, dull, weake and impotent.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This is an excellent way to

The maine ends which all true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religious Chriſtians are to ayme at, are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſet before their eyes<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16. 1 Pet. 2. 12.</note> principally that univerſall ayme and ultimate end of all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and enterpriſes, Gods glory, not their owne private honour and reputation, as too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do, who were never acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p n="2">2. They are open-handed to the poore, and bountifull ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the utmoſt of their pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er, or beyond their abilities, to teſtifie their ſincere and unfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned obedience unto the precepts of the Lord, whom, like bleſſed <hi>David,</hi> they ſet alwaies before<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 9.</note> their eyes, and to whom they have ever reſpect in all their workes.

               <p n="3">3. Another ſcope, that they have in their almes-giving, is to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:15703:150"/> oppoſe the malice of malignant<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5. &amp; 3. 16.</note> ſlanderers, to put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men, and by their well doing, <hi>to make them aſhamed, who falſely accuſe their good converſations in Chriſt.</hi> There is a conviction by good workes, as well as by good words, and there is indeed, no better argument to ſtoppe the mouthes of the enemies of the Goſpell then this, to <hi>non-plus</hi> them by good works,</p>

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:15703:151"/> the hearts of others unto good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and not labour, as ſome do, to caſt water upon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dying ſparkes of zeale in ſome, by queſtioning the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantableneſſe of ſo unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Apoſtolicall courſes, <note n="*" place="margin">Sanderſon ſer.</note>

               <p n="7">7. To teſtifie to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and to give good ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to their owne ſoules, that they are not cozened with cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in ſtead of pure gold, that their other graces are not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeite, but unfained, ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and the true and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worke and gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. Hee that is hardly perſwaded to the exerciſe of charitie, hath juſt cauſe to feare, that he hath no ſparkes of ſaving grace, as yet reſident and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting within his iron ſides; but if thou canſt once make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto thy owne ſoule, that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:15703:152"/> certainely thou beareſt in thy boſome a melting and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate heart, that thou art furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and happily crowned with that perfect and royall grace: Why then, thou maiſt without any fallacie conclude, that thy faith is unfeyned, thy heart pure, thy hope ſtrong and unmoove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, thy ſtate and condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a ſtate of ſalvation, for <hi>by this we know we are tranſlated</hi>

               <p n="2">2. They differ in <hi>the matter,</hi> for the one gives <hi>de proprio</hi> of that which is his owne, which by his owne induſtrie and Gods bleſſing he hath lawfully gotten<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at quaerit Nemo ſed oportet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere.</note> or was by way of donation free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conferred and beſtowed upon him: the other never regards how hee comes by that he hath, whether <hi>Jure</hi> aut <hi>Injuria,</hi> by right or wrong, by hooke or crooke (as they ſay) he cares not ſo hee may ſeeme charitable in giving.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They differ in the manner of giving, the one doth it with a free heart, &amp; cheerfull ſpirit, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, readily, religiouſly, conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably &amp; conſtantly, &amp;c. and that in any ſtate and condition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, in his penury and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocritie, as well as in his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:15703:153"/> and ſuperfluitie, ever to the utmoſt of his abilitie, and ſometimes beyond his power in caſe of extremitie, many times prevents the poore with his almes, communicateth to their neceſſities before he be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or ſolicited, yea, ſometime before his owne turne be ſerved. But on the contrary, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous worldling is a very hold faſt of his earthly treaſures, he ſpares more then needeth, gives onely in his plentie and abundance, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in his mediocritie, never in his povertie, diſtributes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe but by ſtarts, when the fit takes him, or when hee is in ſuch a good moode (as they ſay.)</p>
               <p n="4">4. They differ much in <hi>the time,</hi> the one gives ſeaſonablely and moſt in his time of life: the other for the moſt part unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, and moſt at his death, when hee can keepe his wealth<note place="margin">Sero medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> no longer. The one helps and abates the diſeaſe at the firſt

               <p n="5">5. There is a difference both in <hi>the qualitie,</hi> and <hi>quantitie</hi> of the gift: the one gives bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that which is good, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, profitable, ſalutiferous, and fit for a rich man to give, and poore Chriſtians to receive: The other gives ſparingly the baſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, and unedible reliqu's, which if not caſt upon the poor, ſhould be given unto the dogs.</p>

They differ in the object, in the latitude and extent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; The one is a benefactor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all enemies and friendes, to aged, creeples, the laborious poore, all ſorts of needy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed people, but more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to thoſe whom hee knows to bee pious and religious. But

               <p>Laſtly, they differ in <hi>the end;</hi> The godly have ever in their eye Gods Glory, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as you have heard before mentioned: but the unregenerate and carnall mans ends are onely worldly, and fleſhly; ſome hunt after popular applauſe, and reputation in the<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> world, as Hypocrites doe; ſome aime at merit, the expiation of the guilt of ſinne, meritorious acquiſition of life everlaſting, as
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:15703:155"/> the ſuper-arrogant Papiſts doe: the naturall and unrenewed man never ſets his eye upon the right end, and therefore no marvell, if he ever miſſe his marke, and give to no purpoſe.</p>

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:15703:158"/> good Workes:</hi> (that is, according<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 14.</note> to the Marginall reading of the Text) let ours <hi>profeſſe honeſt Trades,</hi> as if they were the beſt and onely meanes, to uphold good works: Life muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, families maintained, the poore releeved, and this cannot be done without bread, for that is the <hi>ſtaffe of life,</hi> and bread can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gotten (ſaith an excellent<note place="margin">Mr Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſons ſer. 4. ad pop. 373.</note> Divine) but in a lawfull vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As we muſt have a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, wherein to walke, ſo muſt wee labour, and with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence abide in that calling, wee muſt not worke perfunctorily,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:15703:159"/> or by ſtarts (as many Taske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourers doe) but conſtantly,<note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 23.

               <p n="3">3. One maine end of all our
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:15703:159"/> civill actions, politicall imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or corporeall endeavours in our particular callings, muſt be, to give to the poore, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 28. This is to labour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine good works, a thing which very few in their paines-taking, ſeldome, or never dreame of. Our Apoſtle doth not onely teach us this dutie by precept, but alſo by his owne example; he labored with his owne hands, that he might have whereof to miniſter to his owne and others neceſſities, <hi>Act. 20. 34.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="5">5. We muſt be carefull and provident, for you muſt know there is a moderate and chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an providence, as well as an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious<note place="margin">Prov. 27. 23</note>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:15703:160"/> carking, and immoderate carefulneſſe; we muſt looke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently<note place="margin">John. 6. 12.</note> to all our flockes and heards, and gather up all the fragments, that nothing be loſt, and this is a paſſage that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the worldlings to the heart: for this they will do faſt enough of their owne accord without any bidding, for their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ſake, or out of a greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and ambition to riſe and to grow rich in the world. But it is not ſo with the Godly, the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſober Chriſtian, hee walkes in his calling, plies his buſineſſe, improves his time, wit, wealth, and ſtate, becauſe God ſo commands him, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for this end, that he might be the more liberall and able to maintaine good works.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wee muſt deviſe liberall things, be as politike to finde out good workes and enterprizes, as Machiavillians are to invent miſchiefe, and contrive villanies.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:15703:160"/> As men commonly caſt about, how they may thrive and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in their ordinarie courſes, ſo ought we to plot and deviſe with our ſelves, what might bee the wiſeſt and moſt convenient way for us to maintaine good works and to thrive in this Heavenly trade of Almeſ-giving.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Wee muſt bee zealous of<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> good works, as all the redeemed and peculiar people of Chriſt are. We ſhould affect ſuch holy practiſes above any temporary felicities; take a great deale of Spirituall joy and pleaſure in multiplying our Almeſ-deeds, in laying a ſtrong and unmoveable foundation againſt the life to come: wee ſhould bee moved with a pious wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt our owne ſlacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, backewardneſſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens hardneſſe of heart, and alſo with an inward griefe for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we muſt firſt ſeeke the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:15703:161"/> Kingdome of God and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe thereof, firſt we muſt thirſt after ſaving knowledge, and ſpirituall underſtanding, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to abound in the worke of the Lord, and to hoard up grace: then we ſhall not neede to feare the want of any temporall and earthly bleſſing, but all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (according to the promiſe)<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> for this life, ſhall be added unto, and caſt upon us. Though wee may ſometimes be driven to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie like <hi>Job,</hi> or fall into ſome ſeeming (but not reall) outward miſeries, yet we <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 34. 9. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall never want any thing that is good.</hi> Gold ſometimes proves to bee pernicious, and no better than ranke poiſon to mens ſoules, and God in his mercy therefore takes it away from his children: ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of bread, and abundance of his bleſſings ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke men unto Luſt, and the execution of uncleanneſſe and many filthie villanies; therefore
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:15703:161"/> the Lord ſometimes gives them not to his ſervants, but diets them like <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that they might not ſurfet, abuſe the creature, or diſhonour the Creator: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may ſometimes goe hard (alwayes yet well enough) with ſome of Gods people in reſpect of their outward condition. I am ſure there are many faire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of earthly bleſſings made in the Scriptures to thoſe that feare the Lord: Thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Almightie, that love him, and keepe his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>they ſhall inherit ſubſtance</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 21. Job. 22. 24.</note> the Lord will fill up their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, nay, <hi>they ſhall lay up gold as duſt, and the gold of Ophir as the ſtones of the brooks:</hi> So then we ſee, where to beginne; firſt, wee muſt labour to bee rich to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, ſo ſhall wee be ſure (if it ſtand with Gods Glorie, and our good) to bee rich in worldly goods, and rich alſo in good works: If we well obſerve
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:15703:162"/> theſe premiſed rules and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we ſhall undoubtedly learne to maintaine works of mercy for neceſſarie and profitable uſes.</p>

               <p>For, 1. In theſe our ſpirituall

For the better educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inſtruction of illiterate and ignorant youth, many in

               <p>1. In the firſt place, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtate of our country where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live, is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other: a generall and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemicall

This is it, for the preventing of which we are to fight and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice our lives, as David was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do. 1. <hi>Sam. 17 40. Joab,</hi>

Thus reſolute and couragious was <hi>Eſther</hi> for the afflicted Jewes. <hi>Chap. 4. 16. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar rules are theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt remember that charity (according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeech) ought to begin at home: we muſt in the firſt place provide for our owne houſe and family. <hi>Gen. 30. 30.

The labourer (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſpirituall or carnall things is worthy of his hire, and wee ſhall find that the Lord provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a law to this purpoſe. <hi>Lev.</hi> 15. 12. 13. 14.

This place therefore you ſee is notoriouſly abuſed, and perverted by too many Covetous, and Carnall wordlings, who like Spiders ſucke nothing but poiſon out of the ſweet flowers that grow in the Paradiſe of the Scriptures.

Hee is ſo farre from giving liberty unto worldlings to carke and care for poſteritie immoderately as they doe, that he rather perſwads all good Chriſtians in thoſe very words, unto liberality and the duties of Charity; ſo then wee will retort the Argument, and breake the covetous mans pare with his owne weapon, thus, He that will not provide for his
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:15703:214"/> owne houſe, or his kindred is worſe than an Infidell: (that is) He that is not Charitable and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall unto his Parents, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, and unto his poore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed and impotent Kindred though they live not in his houſe, but are planted abroad from him, That man may bee ſaid to bee worſe than an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell; therefore thoſe covetous and carnall men that carke and care, onely for thoſe that are under the ſame roofe with them, they are moſt mercileſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable wretches, no better, nay worſe than Infidels.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In a third place we muſt<note place="margin">Prov. 3. 27. 28.</note> lend a helping hand unto our poore neighbours and common friends and familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance who live in the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with us, with whom wee have mutuall ſocietie, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and commerce unto whom, as we are neere in ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo we ſhould bee in affection
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:15703:215"/> and readineſſe to helpe them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities. Not onely Divine, but humane Lawes doe impoſe a neceſſity upon us to be Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our poore neigbours, both which wee muſt obey for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake: And although there bee the ſtrong Obligation of a twofold precept to tye us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, yet our acts of Charity are not the leſſe commendable, if we give with a Charitable heart, and willing affection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. After theſe we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe<note place="margin">Deut. 15. 7.

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:15703:215"/> doctrine may, perhaps, ſeeme to be a <hi>Paradox</hi> unto revengefull and vindictive ſpirits. But reade, I pray, theſe Scriptures, <hi>Luk. 6. 35. Rom. 12. 20.

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:15703:216"/> love, and theſe Civill natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and Morall actions. But to feed and refreſh our very deadly and approved enemies, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> counſel'd <hi>Jehoram</hi> to do, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 22. is a good Argument of ſelfe-deniall, of a gratious heart and humble diſpoſition, and it is a notable worke of Mercy, which ſhall not be unrewarded at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe in the relieving of the truely poore and needy, there muſt needs bee a Prioritie, and Poſterioritie, obſerve againe that we are to ſuccour.</p>

Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe among thoſe that are reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſome may ſtand more in neede than others, it concernes us to be very reſpective unto, and tenderly watchfull over thoſe that are impriſoned, baniſhed, or maliciouſly perſecuted for Chriſt and his Goſpell ſake.

Wee can never reape any comfort from this our conceited Charitie, and liberalitie, becauſe the concomitants, &amp; conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hereof are apparantly evill, and unlawful: for in relieving va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garant, towns-end beggers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apoſtles rule, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect the wiſdome of the holy Ghoſt, alſo the wiſedome of the King, and State, we diſobey and contemne authoritie, incur ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times many penalties, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niarie mulcts, which we are loth to pay; and harden them in their moſt curſed and heathniſh cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:15703:220"/> Charitie certainly is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious and oppoſite to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, it doth not elevate or puffe men up, it doth not ſuffer them to adore their owne fancies and conceits, nor to preferre their owne private opinions before the Lawes of their Soveraigne. Therefore let no man delude himſelfe, and others too, by this indiſcrete beneficence, and (as I may ſo ſpeake) uncharitable charitie. Theſe Ulcers and Dron's of the Common-wealth are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any honeſt mans Almes, and he that ſhewes them mercie, doth them, and himſelfe, and his Soveraigne, and the Common-wealth, much wrong and injurie.

After this cruell and bloody act of his, in not redeeming the captives (for he had a finger in their ſlaughter as well as the enemie, becauſe he might have ſaved their lives) he never thrived or proſpered in any thing hee went about, the Lord gave him over to the horrours of a troubled and wounded ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to bee vexed with continuall feare of treaſon, and to bee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the praeapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the torments of hell, but praying againſt thoſe future paines and puniſhments which he feared in another world, and

The ſtrongeſt and worſt objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (for all are naught, that are made againſt Charitie) I will firſt propound, aſſoile, and cleare as briefly as I can; and although ſome are ſo ſenſeleſſe, and fooliſh that a <hi>Recitare</hi> were a ſufficient <hi>Refutare:</hi> yet becauſe every one likes his owne things beſt, and judges of his owne conceits, as the Beare doth of her whelps, that they are of all creatures the faireſt, I will miſ-pend ſo much time, as to give ſatisfaction to every triviall objection, that ſo all the mouthes of baſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings might be ſtopped.</p>

               <p>1. If this bee true (as I can <label type="milestone">

                  </label> were, yet they muſt be relieved. Secondly, thou thy ſelfe art of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes unthankefull to God, and yet he ceaſeth not to follow thee with his continual bleſſings, and therefore oughteſt thou to<note place="margin">Act. 9. 33.

Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Job. 31. 20.</note> their ingratitude is their owne ſinne, not thine, it doth thee no harme, but is altogether hurtfull to themſelves.

God forbid. Seaventhly, conſider if thou giveſt ſtill, and knoweſt that thou ſhalt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing backe againe, no not ſo much as thanks for thy good deeds, the more true is thy Charitie, and the greater ſhall thy reward bee with God. For if wee ſeeke any recompence with men, wee ſhall ſurely looſe it with God. Laſtly, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the Lord (to whom wee become creditors, if<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> wee give liberally to the poore) undertakes to bee our Pay-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, we have his Word, his Bill
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:15703:233"/> and Bond for it: and if wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any thing backe againe for our charitable practiſes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Prov. 19. 17.</note> good turnes, wee muſt looke for it at his hands.</p>

               </p>
               <p>1. All are not ſo: ſome poor <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> are honeſt, and of good report, and of unblameable converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Picke out theſe for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of thy Charitie, if thou wilt doe nothing for the other. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, thou art not to releeve their lewdneſſe, but their pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and thou muſt ſuccour and ſuſtaine them as they be men, not as they be tranſgreſſors. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 45.</note> our Heavenly-Father giveth to the good, and to the wicked, and remember, we muſt be mercifull as he is mercifull. Fourthly, we are to know that our owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe is great before God, yet wee beg of him and expect his Almes: are the poore more
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:15703:233"/> unworthie of our Charitie, than we are of Gods gratious libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie? Doubtleſſe not.

Sixthly, when thou releeveſt their neceſſities, friendly reprove their ill courſes and conditions: Thy Almes and bountifulneſſe may bee a good meanes to mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie their ſtubborne natures, and to worke them to amendment. Laſtly, 'tis better to feede tenne unworthy and graceleſſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, than to let Chriſt goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, and unrefreſhed, in one poore <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When they receive our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they abuſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The aſſertion is falſe, if univerſall, and doe not miſpend Gods bleſſings, ſome uſe them well, give therefore to them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, doe not we abuſe Gods
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:15703:234"/> good creatures too much and too often, whereby though we grievouſly offend his Sacred Majeſtie, yet doe not wee ceaſe to begge, neither doth he leave off to give. Thirdly, the poore in miſ-imploying the fruits of our almes, wrong themſelves, not us, they can abuſe but a little but wee doe a great deale, this then is but a poore pretence to excuſe any from works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Fourthly, If we know who they are that will waſte and conſume the money which wee give them, then let us be liberall unto them in other things more needfull, let us labour by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent admonitions, and friendly objurgations to reforme them, far bee it from us ever to harden our hearts, and wholy to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our hands from ſuccoring them, in their miſeries and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame neceſſities, but if they perſiſt in their wicked wayes, let us complaine of them unto au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:15703:234"/> whoſe Charity is <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordia puniens,</hi> Mercifull ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation and correction for their amendment.</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuppoſe thou haſt nothing (which is but a groundleſſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) remember what our Saviours charge is, <hi>Sell that you have, and give almes,</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 33. ver. 22. 29. 30.</note> whereof is this, as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant out of the precedent &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent words: do not tyre and weary your ſpirits, nor weare out<note place="margin">Mar. 10. 24 Pſa. 62. 10.</note> your pretious time about carnall and worldly things, do not cark and care immoderately for theſe earthly and tranſitorie trifles, truſt not in your wealth, glew not your affections to your ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>ſet not your hearts upon them,</hi> but rather ſell that ye haue
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:15703:241"/> and give almes to the poore and needy, rather lay up treaſures in heaven, then bagges in earth, rather grow rich towards God by relieving the poore, then great and glorious among men by hoarding up ſtore of wealth in your coffers, the which at the beſt, in reſpect of true happineſſe is but a baſe incertaine, inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and beggarly condition. Thirdly, looke upon the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Saints in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> how many of them ſold all that they had to relieve the poore brethren, which were under any grievance, preſſure, or diſtreſſe. They were themſelves under perſecutions, perſued with mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious enemies, compelled to fly hither and thither, for their own ſafetie and preſervation, yet they ſtuck cloſe to the promiſes, they reſted on their God, never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any queſtion what ſhould become of them, when they had given away all. But here is to
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:15703:242"/> be noted, the caſe muſt be alike, if we imitate their practices, for the Apoſtle in theſe caſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an equalitie, and would not have ſome eaſed and others burthened overmuch. 2. <hi>Cor. 8. 13.</hi>
               </p>

Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> had
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:15703:242"/> ten children, yet he was a man wonderfully, compaſſionate and bountifull to the poore: a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example wee haue alſo of one Mrs <hi>Owen</hi> of <hi>Iſtington</hi> who had-two and twenty children, notwithſtanding in her life time ſhe built an Hoſpitall, and gave to it fifty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> a free Schoole, to which ſhee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a ſufficient ſtipend, ſhee gave two hundred pounds to <hi>Oxford library,</hi> and to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pious and charitable works as much as amounted to the ſumme of 2500. pounds and upwards. Thirdly, a good wife and children are the gifts and bleſſings of God, and ſhall this his goodneſſe towards thee be a cauſe of thy ingratitude to him and uncharitableneſſe to thy neighbour. Fourthly, thy carking, and caring, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate thoughtfullneſſe about the things of the world is to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe. <hi>Luke.</hi> 12. 25, 26. It

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 31. 34. 1 Pet. 5. 7. Jer. 49. 11.</note> telleth us. Fifthly, Chriſt commandeth us not to care doubtingly for theſe earthly things, and the Apoſtle would have us to caſt all our care upon God, who careth for us, and promiſeth to provide for wife and children. Sixtly, What is the ayme and end of thy earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſſe, of thy faithleſſe, fruitleſſe, and immoderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and carefullneſſe? If it be to greaten thy poſterity, or to leave thy children in a good and bleſſed ſtate and condition, why then be mercifull to the poore, <hi>ſo ſhall thy ſeed be bleſſed, builders up of the old waſt places, and raiſers up for many foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for many generations.

Thirdly, haſt thou ſuffered ſuch a ſhipwracke in thy eſtate, that thou haſt nothing remaining with unfortunate <hi>Job,</hi> why then
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:15703:245"/> thy excuſe is ſomwhat tolerable but &amp; if thy caſe be not ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, give then of that which is left in hope of beter ſucces, for future time, obey God herein, ſtill truſting in his mercy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. 6. for he is all ſufficient, he can, and will ſupply thy wants and defects. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 8. 4. If ſuch pretenſions of loſſes and croſſes might exempt men from this duty, how then ſhall the poore be relieved? for there bee very few who have not a ſhare in thoſe common afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereunto mortality is very liable and obnoxious.

               <p>1. Thus the rich Glutton in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> the Goſpell, who fared delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly every day, might have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered poore <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and thus in effect rich <hi>Nabal</hi> replied to <hi>Davids</hi> ſervants. Secondly, thou muſt not meaſure thy need by thy luxurious, ſuperfluous, and idle expences: thoſe things are to be accounted neceſſaries, not which men can or doe ſpend, but what they ought to ſpend in houſe-keeping. There is no man of ſo vaſt and unlimited an eſtate but may make riddance of all before the yeeres end, if hee bee ſo prodigally diſpoſed. Although thou haſt goodly meanes, a plentifull inheritance, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe patrimonie left thee, yet if thou ſpend, thou careſt not what, and knoweſt not how, if
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:15703:247"/> thou wilt bee an entertainer of good-fellowes and the like rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of idle, graceleſſe, and lewd companions, if thou wilt ſuffer thy ſervants to live as they liſt, thy children to runne out with the Prodigall in the Goſpell, thy meanes certainely cannot hold out, thou wilt ſcarſe have enough for thy wife and family, and ſo there will be no portion for the poore, wherefore this is but a poore plea, to object that thou ſpendeſt all, and makeſt even at the yeeres end. Here in thou art the more culpable in that thou art not onely a mercileſſe man, but alſo a graceleſſe and careleſſe Prodigall. If thou wouldeſt play the part of a wiſe and righteous man, and order thy affaires with judgement and diſcretion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 5. there would be ſufficient for thy owne private and needefull expences, and a ſupply alſo for the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the poore. If <hi>Dives</hi> had
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:15703:247"/> abated ſomewhat of his too coſtly rayment, and ſumptuous fare, and if <hi>Nabal</hi> had not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted like a king, nor tipled ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperately, the one might very well have ſuſtained the life of poore hungrie <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the other might have releeved <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and his ſervants without any dammage or detriment to themſelves at all: And if the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious drunkards and joviall revellers of our times were more abſtemious, moderate, and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as they ought, they might be farre more liberall than they are to the poore. Thirdly, if thou replieſt, that thou ſpendeſt all, and neither needleſſely, nor rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly, nor ſuperfluouſly, that thou art frugall, provident, and circumſpect enough, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of thy affaires, but yet canſt not thrive, nor make thy meanes hold out to maintaine thy family, and the poore; then let mee adviſe thee to conſider
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:15703:248"/> with thy ſelfe, what might bee the reaſon of this thy infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſucceſſe in thy buſineſſes and the cauſe thou art no better bleſſed: Certainely, it is to bee feared, that thou haſt beene un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull, and incompaſſionate to the poore, and therefore ſuch a canker and curſe doth adhere unto thy wealth, that like a man in a conſumption it cannot proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or thrive, but rather pines and vaniſhes away by little and little into nothing. <hi>He that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth more than is meete, or dealeth with a ſlacke hand ſhall ſoone become poore, Prov.</hi> 11. 24. &amp; 10. 4. And if thou deſireſt to thrive and fare well in the world then be mercifull to the poore, for he that hath a bountifull eye ſhall bee bleſſed. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 9. Perhaps thou wilt ſay that thou laboureſt in things which are good and lawfull, yet in thy labours and endeavours thou haſt not that true and right aime
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:15703:248"/> which thou ſhouldſt have (<hi>viz.</hi>) the releeving of the poore, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 28. and therefore thy labours are alſo fruitleſſe and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for if thou wouldeſt be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, thou ſhouldeſt be bleſſed upon earth, <hi>Deut. 15. 10.
